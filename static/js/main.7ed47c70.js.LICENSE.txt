     *
     * To developers.
     * To simplify Tool structure, we split it to 4 parts:
     *  1) index.js — main Tool's interface, public API and methods for working with data
     *  2) uploader.js — module that has methods for sending files via AJAX: from device, by URL or File pasting
     *  3) ui.js — module for UI manipulations: render, showing preloader, etc
     *  4) tunes.js — working with Block Tunes: render buttons, handle clicks
     *
     * For debug purposes there is a testing server
     * that can save uploaded files and return a Response {@link UploadResponseFormat}
     *
     *       $ node dev/server.js
     *
     * It will expose 8008 port, so you can pass http://localhost:8008 with the Tools config:
     *
     * image: {
     *   class: ImageTool,
     *   config: {
     *     endpoints: {
     *       byFile: 'http://localhost:8008/uploadFile',
     *       byUrl: 'http://localhost:8008/fetchUrl',
     *     }
     *   },
     * },
